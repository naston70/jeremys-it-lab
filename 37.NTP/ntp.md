## NTP

- All devices have an internal clock
- In Cisco you can view the time with ```show clock```
- If you use ```show clock detail``` you will see the time source; the hardware calendar is the default time source. If an * is present before the time this indicates the time is not considered authoritative
- The internal hardware clock of a device will drift over time, so it is not the default time source
- From a CCNA perspective the most important reason to have accurate time is for viewing logs
