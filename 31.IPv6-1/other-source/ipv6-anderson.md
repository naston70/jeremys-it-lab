## The Need for IPv6

* NAT breaks the end to end IP model
* Can cause issues with security and some applications

- Devices such as application layer firewalls, traversal servers and proxy servers can help with these issues
- A cleaner solution is for IP to support an addressing scheme big enough to give all devices in the world a publicly reachable address
