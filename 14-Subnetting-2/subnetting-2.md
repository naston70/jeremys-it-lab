# Subnetting

Answer to first example:

Divide 192.168.1.0/24 into 4 networks with minimum 45 hosts in each network

/26 provides closest match

HINT: Find the broadcast address of subnet 1. The next address is the network address of subnet 2. Repeat this for subnets 3 and 4.

Subnet 1 = 192.168.1.0/26
