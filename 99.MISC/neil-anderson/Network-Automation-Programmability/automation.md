## Benefits of Automation and Programmability

Traditional way to manage network devices is one at a time using SSH to the command line. Copying and pasting from a text file template is common. GUI tools to manage one device at a time have also been available for a long time but have typically been slow and inefficient 

#### NMS - Network Management Systems 
- NMS such as SolarWinds, CiscoWorks and Cisco Prime Infrastructure are available
- They use protocols such as SNMP and Netflow to gather information and report on the state of the network
- SNMP was originally proposed in 1988
- SNMP can also be used to push configuration to devices but it has limited functionality 
- Solutions can be complex and difficult to implement 
- SNMP also has security concerns
