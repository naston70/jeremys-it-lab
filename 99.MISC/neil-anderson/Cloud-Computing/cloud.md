## Cloud Computing

#### Traditional IT Deployment Models 

- Traditional deployment models for IT services before Cloud:
    * On premises solutions
    * Colocation or 'Colo' services 

**On premise:**
    - all equipment located in your building
    - all equipment owned by you
    - clear lines of demarcation
    - equipment is CapEx
    - new equipment takes over a week to deploy
    - equipment requires technology refreshes 
    - redundancy needs to be considered 

**Colocation:**
    * A 'colo' is a data center location where the owner of the facility rents out space to external customers
    * The facility owner provides power, cooling and physical security for their customers server, storage and networking equipment
    * Independent colo providers such as Equinix offer customers multiple network connectivity options through a choice of network service providers 
    * Network service providers will also typically peer with each other in colo facilities 

#### Colo Solutions Characteristics 

- The colo provider owns the data center facility and is responsible for providing highly available power, cooling and physical security
- You own your own server, storage and networking equipment within the colo facility 
- The connections between your offices and the colo are your network service providers responsibility
- Equipment within the colo facility is a CapEx cost 
- Monthly colo hosting fees are an OpEX expense 
- New equipment will typically take over a week to deploy 
- Equipment requires technology refreshes 
- Redundancy needs to be considered 

## Defining Cloud Computing 

- Tends to be describes as 'IT services which are located somewhere else'
- But, colo facilities are off premise and are not cloud 
- Private cloud deployments are often on premise 
- NIST provides the following definition:

"Cloud computing is a model of enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction"

###### On-Demand Self-Service
'A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider'

###### Rapid Elasticity
'Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time'
