#### Traditional IT Deployment Models 

- Traditional deployment models for IT services before Cloud:
    * On premises solutions
    * Colocation or 'Colo' services 

**On premise:**
    - all equipment located in your building
    - all equipment owned by you
    - clear lines of demarcation
    - equipment is CapEx
    - new equipment takes over a week to deploy
    - equipment requires technology refreshes 
    - redundancy needs to be considered 

**Colocation:**
    * A 'colo' is a data center location where the owner of the facility rents out space to external customers
    * The facility owner provides power, cooling and physical security for their customers server, storage and networking equipment
    * Independent colo providers such as Equinix offer customers multiple network connectivity options through a choice of network service providers 
    * Network service providers will also typically peer with each other in colo facilities
