## WAN Overview

- LAN: a network that connect computers and other devices in a relatively small area, typically a small building or group of buildings
- WAN: a geographically distributed network that connects multiple LANs together
- MAN: a network that connects computers and other devices in an area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN

LAN Design - Collapsed distribution and core, a larger LAN has three layers

WANs can be connected and built in a variety of different ways

## VPN - Virtual Private Networks

* A private network uses links which are dedicated for an individual organisation
* Local Area Networks are private networks 
* WANs can also use physical links which are dedicated for an individual organisation

- A VPN provides a virtual tunnel between private networks across a shared public network such as the Internet
- Traffic traveling over the tunnel is encrypted and only readable by the authorised users on both sides
- Users can share data over the tunnel as if they were connected with a dedicated private link
