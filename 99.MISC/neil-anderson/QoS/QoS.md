## Quality of Service

#### Dedicated Voice, Video and Data Networks 

QoS is queuing - Old network setup was to have 3 seperate networks for voice, video and data. 
Modern networks run Converged Networks where all three run over the same IP network 

- This enables cost savings and advanced features for voice and video 
- Data, voice and video are now all fighting for the same shared bandwidth

#### Quality Requirement for Voice and Video

* Voice and traditional standard definition video packets must meet these recommend requirements to be an acceptable quality call
    * Latency < 150 ms 
    * Jitter  < 30 ms 
    * Loss    < 1% 
* These are one-way requirements, meaning a packet sent from a phone in HQ has 150ms to reach the phone in the branch and vice versa
* HD video has stricter requirements
