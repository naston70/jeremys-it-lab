## DNS - Domain Name System

#### The purpose of DNS

- DNS is used to resolve human-readable names to IP addresses
- Machines use addresses, not names
- Names are easier for humans to remember
- When a website name is typed into a browser, the device will ask a DNS server for the IP addresses
- The DNS servers can be configured manually or learned via DHCP

#### DNS in Cisco IOS

* For hosts in a network to use DNS, DNS does not have to be configured on the routers. They will simply forward the DNS messages like any other packets
* However, a Cisco router can be configured as a DNS server, although it is rare. Usually windows or Linux server
* A Cisco router can also be configured as a DNS client
