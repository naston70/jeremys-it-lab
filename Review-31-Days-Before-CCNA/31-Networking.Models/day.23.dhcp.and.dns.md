#### DHCPV4

DHCPV4 allows a host to obtain an IP address dynamically when it connects to the network. The DHCPv4 client contacts the DHCPv4 server by sending a request for an IP address. The DHCPv4 server chooses an address from a configured range called a pool and assigns it to the host client for a set period.
