## Wireless Standards

The 802.11 WLAN standards define how radio frequencies are used for wireless links. To avoid interference, different channels within an RF can be used.

#### RF Spectrum

The RF spectrum includes all types of radio communications, including 2.4GHz and 5-GHz frequencies used by wireless devices.

###### Channels

A frequency range is typically called a band of frequencies. ie, a wireless LAN device with 2.4-GHz antenna can actually use any frequency from 2.4000 to 2.4835 GHz. The 5-GHz band lies between 5.150 and 5.825.

The bands are further subdivided into frequency channels. Channels become particularly important when the wireless devices in a specific area become saturated. Each channel is known by a channel number and is assigned to a specific frequency. As long as the channels are defined by a national or international standards body, they can be used consistently in all locations.

The 5-GHz band consists of nonoverlapping channels. Each channel is allocated a frequency range that does not encroach on or overlap the frequencies allocated for any other channel. This is not true with 2.4-GHz, the only way to avoid any overlap between adjacent channels is to configure access points (APs) to use only one channels 1,6 and 11

#### 802.11 Standards

Most of the standards specify that a wireless device must have one antenna to transmit and receive wireless signals on the specified radio frequency. Some of the newer standards that transmit and receive at higher speeds require APs and wireless client to have multiple antennas using the multiple input multiple output technology (MIMO). MIMO uses multiple antennas as both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance. Up to four antennas can be supported. 

#### Wireless Topologies

The 802.11 standard identifies two main wireless topology modes: **infrastructure mode** and **Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)**.
IBSS is also known as ad-hoc mode. With the ubiquity of wireless networks, mesh topologies are now common.
