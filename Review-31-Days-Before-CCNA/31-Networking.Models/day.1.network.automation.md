## Network Automation 

Exam Topics:

- Explain how automation impacts network management
- Describe characteristics of REST based APIs (CRUD, HTTP verbs, data encoding)
- Recognize the capabilities of configuration management mechanisms Puppet, Chef, and Ansible
- Interpret JSON encoded data

#### Data Formats

Data formats provide a way to store and exchange data in a structured format. These are some common data formats used in network automation and programmability:

* JavaScript Object Notation
* Extensible Markup Language
* YAML Ain't Markup Language

#### Data Format Comparison

| Data | Central Purpose        | Common use     |
|------|------------------------|----------------|
|      |                        |                |
| JSON | General data modelling | REST APIs      |
| XML  | Data text markup       | REST APIs, web |
| YAML | General modelling      | Ansible        |
|      |                        |                |

#### JSON Data Format 

JSON is human-readable data format used by applications for storing, transferring and reading data. It is easy to parse and can be used with most modern programming languages

###### JSON Syntax Rules 

JSON data is a collection of key:value pairs that follow these rules:

- One key:value pair
- Key: text inside double quotes and before the colon that is used as the name that references a value
- Value: The item after the colon that represents the value of the key, which can be:
    * Text
    * Numeric
    * Array
    * Object
- Multiple pairs: when listing multiple key:value pairs, seperate the pairs with a comma at the end of each pair, except the last.
