## How Routers Learn About Routes 

To be able to route a packet, a router must know at least the following:

* Destination address to where the packet is destined.
* Neighboring routers from which remote networks can be learned and packets can be moved to on way to its destination 
* Routes to remote networks and a way to determine the best route to each of them 
* Ways to learn, verify and manage routing information. Incomplete, incorrect or unstable routing information is worse than not having any routing information. If a router does not have routing information it will drop packets and inform the source. If the router has incorrect information loops can form and possibly bring networks down.
