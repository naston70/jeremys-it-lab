## Boson 3rd Review

In a split-MAC deployment, a lightweight access point is responsible for prioritizing packets and responding to beacon and probe requests. 

In a Cisco Unified Wireless Network deployment, the MAC functions that are normally handled by a single device in an autonomous wireless network a distributed between lightweight APs and and Wireless LAN Controllers. The functionality provided by the lightweight AP includes handling real-time processing of data, such as sending and receiving 802.11 traffic, responding to beacons and probe messages, encryption and packet prioritization. In addition the lightweight AP must send management information to the WLC so that the WLC can forward the information to a management station.

By contrast, a WLC handles tasks that are not time sensitive, such as security management, lightweight AP configuration management and client load balancing. The WLC is also responsible for client association requests, data encapsulation, client authentication, key exchange, security policy enforcement and Radio frequency management

If a PD attempts to draw more power than the cutoff power from a POE interface, how long will the interface remain in error-disabled state?

a. until it is manually reset with the shutdown and no shutdown commands
