## Security Fundamentals

Cyber criminals now have the expertise and tools to take down critical infrastructure and systems. Specific terminology is used to describe their tools and attacks.

#### Security Terms

Assets must be identified and protected. Vulnerabilities must be addresses before they become threats and are exploited. Mitigation techniques are required before, during and after an attack.

###### Security Terms Table

| Term          | Description                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
|               |                                                |
| Assets        | Anything of value, data, resources etc         |
| Vulnerability | A weakness in a system or its design           |
| Threat        | A potential danger to a company's assets       |
| Areas         | Support the same two-level hierarchy           |
| Exploit       | A mechanism that takes advantage of a vuln     |
| Mitigation    | The process of taking countermeasures          |
| Risk          | The likelihood of a threat exploiting the Vuln |

#### Attack Vectors and Data Exfiltration

An attack vector is a path by which a threat actor can gain access to a server, host or network, Attack vectors originate inside or outside a network. For example, threat actors may target a network through the Internet to disrupt Network operations and create a DoS attack.

Internal threats have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats because internal users have direct access to the building and its infrastructure devices. 

Employees may also have knowledge of the corporate network, its resources and its confidential data. Data loss or data exfiltration occurs when data is intentionally or unintentionally lost, stolen or leaked. Network security professionals must protect organizations data. Various data loss prevention controls must be implemented (DLP), combining strategic, operational and tactical measures.
