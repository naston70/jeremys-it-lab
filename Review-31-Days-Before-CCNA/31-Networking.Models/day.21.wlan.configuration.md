## Logging into a Cisco WLC

In order to configure a WLC, access is required. The WLC requires an initial configuration and a management IP address before you can access it with a web browser through HTTP or HTTPS. The initial configuration requires a console connection. The WLC can also be further configured from the command-line interface using Telnet or SSH. The CCNA focuses on GUI access to the WLC.

The Network Summary page is a dashboard that provides a quick overview of the number of configured wireless networks, associate access points and active clients.

#### Network Summary Dashboard

In the menu on the left of the network summary page click **Access Points** to view an overall picture of AP system information and performance.
Click **Advanced** to access the advanced Summary page. From here you can access all the features of the WLC.
