## Inter VLAN Routing

## Exam Topics
* Configure and verify IPv4 addressing and subnetting
* Configure and verify interswitch connectivity

Concepts:

Inter-VLAN communications cannot occur without a layer 4 device. Three options are available while implementing inter-vlan routing.

- Traditional or legacy inter-VLAN routing 
- Router on a Stick
- Multilayer switching 

## Legacy Inter-VLAN Routing 

Legacy Inter-VLAN routing requires multiple physical interfaces on both the router and the switch. When using a router to facilitate inter-VLAN routing, the router interfaces can be connected to seperate VLANs. Devices on those VLANs send traffic through the router to reach other VLANs.
