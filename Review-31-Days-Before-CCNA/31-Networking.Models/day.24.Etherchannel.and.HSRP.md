## EtherChannel and HSRP

#### Exam Topics

- Configure and verify EtherChannel
- Describe the purpose of first hop redundancy protocol

EtherChannel enables you to bundle multiple physical interfaces into one logical channel to increase the bandwidth on point-to-point links. In addition, EtherChannel provides a sway to prevent the need for Spanning Tree Protocol convergence when only a single port or cable failure occurs

Most end devices do not store routes to reach remote networks. Instead, an end device is typically configured with a default gateway than handles routing for the device. 

What if this device fails? To ensure that a device will still have access to remote networks, you should implement some type of default gateway redundancy in the network. That is the role of first-hop redundancy protocols (FHRPs)
