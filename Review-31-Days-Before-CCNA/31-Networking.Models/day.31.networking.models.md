## Day 31

#### CCNA EXAM TOPICS:

* Explain the role and function of network components
* Describe characteristics f network topology architectures
* Compare physical interface and cabling types
* Identify interface and cable issues
* Compare TCP to UDP

#### Key Points:

Both the OSI and TCP/IP networking models are important for understanding networks.

###### The OSI and TCP/IP models

To understand how communication occurs across the network, you can use layered models as a framework for representing and explaining networking concepts and technologies. OSI and TCP/IP support interoperability between competing vendor product lines.

###### OSI Layers

- Application = 7
    * Refers to interfaces between network and Application software. Also includes authentication

- Presentation = 6
    * Defines the format and organization of data. Includes encryption

- Session = 5
    * Establishes and maintains end-to-end bidirectional flows between end points.

- Transport = 4
    * Connection establishment and termination, flow control, error recovery and segmentation of large data blocks into smaller parts for transmission

- Network = 3
    * Refers to logical addressing, routing and path determination 

- Data Link = 2
    * Formats data into frames appropriate for transmission onto some physical medium. Defines rules for when that medium can be used and defines the means by which to recognize transmission errors

- Physical = 1
    * Defines the electrical, optical, cabling, connectors and procedural details required for transmitting bits, represented as some form of energy passing over a physical medium
