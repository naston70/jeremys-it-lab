## Day 31

#### CCNA EXAM TOPICS:

* Explain the role and function of network components
* Describe characteristics f network topology architectures
* Compare physical interface and cabling types
* Identify interface and cable issues
* Compare TCP to UDP

#### Key Points:

Both the OSI and TCP/IP networking models are important for understanding networks.

###### The OSI and TCP/IP models

To understand how communication occurs across the network, you can use layered models as a framework for representing and explaining networking concepts and technologies. OSI and TCP/IP support interoperability between competing vendor product lines.
