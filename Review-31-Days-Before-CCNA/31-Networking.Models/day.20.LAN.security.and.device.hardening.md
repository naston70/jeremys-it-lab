## Endpoint Security 

Endpoints are hosts including laptops, desktops, servers, and IP phones. In addition, a network that has a BYOD policy includes employee owned devices. Endpoints are particularly susceptible to malware-related attacks that originate through email or web browsing. If an end point is infiltrated, it can become a point from which a threat actor can gain access to critical system devices, such as servers and sensitive information. 

Endpoints are best protected by host-bases Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) software. AMP products include endpoint solutions such as Cisco AMP for Endpoints. In addition, content security appliances provide fine-grained control over email and web browsing for an organizations users.
