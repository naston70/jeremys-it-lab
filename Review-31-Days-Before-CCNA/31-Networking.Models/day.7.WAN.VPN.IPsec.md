#### WAN Topologies

There are four basic WAN topology options that a business can select for its WAN infrastructure
* Point to point: typically uses a leased-line connection 
* Hub-and-spoke: Offers a single homed, point to multipoint topology in which a single interface on the hub router can be shared with multiple spoke routers through the use of virtual interfaces
* Full mesh: gives each router a connection to every other router. Requires a large number of interfaces
* Dual-homed: Provides redundancy for a single homed hub-and-spoke topology by providing a second hub to connect to spoke routers
