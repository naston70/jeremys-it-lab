## WAN, VPN and IPsec

#### WAN Topologies

There are four basic WAN topology options that a business can select for its WAN infrastructure
* Point to point: typically uses a leased-line connection 
* Hub-and-spoke: Offers a single homed, point to multipoint topology in which a single interface on the hub router can be shared with multiple spoke routers through the use of virtual interfaces
* Full mesh: gives each router a connection to every other router. Requires a large number of interfaces
* Dual-homed: Provides redundancy for a single homed hub-and-spoke topology by providing a second hub to connect to spoke routers

## WAN Connection Options

Many options for implementing WAN solutions are currently available. They differ in speed, cost and technology. Requires

#### WAN Link Connection Options:

WAN:

**Private:**- Dedicated = Leased Lines
            - Switched = Circuit Switched (PTSN-ISDN) and Packet Switched (Frame Relay, Metro Ethernet x25 ATM)

**Public:**- Internet -> Broadband VPN -> DSL, Cable, Wireless

#### Dedicated Connection Options

Also called leased lines, dedicated connections are established point-to-point WAN connections from the customer premises through the provider network to a remote destination 

Leased lines are usually more expensive than switched services because of the dedicated, always on cost of providing WAN services to the customer. The dedicated capacity removes latency and jitter and provides a layer of security because only the customers traffic is allowed on the link
