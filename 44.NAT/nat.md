## NAT - Network Address Translation

#### Private IPv4 Addresses (RFC 1918)

* IPv4 doesn't provide enough addresses for all devices that need an IP address in the modern world
* The long term solution is to switch to IPv6
* There are 3 main short term solutions:
    - 1. CIDR
    - 2. Private IPv4 Addresses
    - 3. NAT
* RFC 1918 specifies the following IPv4 ranges as private:
    * 10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255)
    * 172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255)
    * 192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255)

* Private IP's cannot be used over the Internet
