### ARP

* ARP stands for 'Address Resolution Protocol'
* ARP is used to discover the Layer 2 address (MAC) of a known Layer 3 address (IP)
* It consists of two messages:
	- ARP Request
	- ARP Reply
* ARP Request is **broadcast:** sent to all hosts on the network
* ARP Reply is **unicast:** sent only to one host (host that sent the request)
