## What is Subnetting? 

Subnetting is taking one network and dividing it into sub-networks

For example 10.0.0.x /24 can be divided into 2 equal /25s

10.0.0.0/24 = |0 - 255| 1 network
10.0.0.0/25 = |0 - 127| & |128 - 255| 2 networks
10.0.0.0/26 = |0 - 63| & |64 - 127| & |128 - 191| & |192 - 255| 4 networks


When you divide a network it is possible to extract seven attributes.

Network ID - first address in each subnet
Broadcast ID - last address in each subnet
First Host IP - network id + 1
Last Host IP - broadcast id - 1
Next Network - broadcast id + 1
No. IP addresses - number of addresses
CIDR/Subnet - convert between both

## Cheat Sheet

From left to write 1 - 128 (doubling)

128   64   32   16   8   4   2   1

Then subtract that number from 255

128   192  224  240  248  252  254  255

/25   /26  /27  /28  /29  /30  /31  /32

###### Problem 1

10.1.1.55 /28
