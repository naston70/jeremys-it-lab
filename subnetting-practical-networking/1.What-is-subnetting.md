## What is Subnetting? 

Subnetting is taking one network and dividing it into sub-networks

For example 10.0.0.x /24 can be divided into 2 equal /25s

10.0.0.0/24 = |0 - 255| 1 network
10.0.0.0/25 = |0 - 127| & |128 - 255| 2 networks
10.0.0.0/26 = |0 - 63| & |64 - 127| & |128 - 191| & |192 - 255| 4 networks


When you divide a network it is possible to extract seven attributes.

Network ID - first address in each subnet
Broadcast ID - last address in each subnet
First Host IP - network id + 1
Last Host IP - broadcast id - 1
Next Network - broadcast id + 1
No. IP addresses - number of addresses
CIDR/Subnet - convert between both

## Cheat Sheet

From left to write 1 - 128 (doubling)

128   64   32   16   8   4   2   1

Then subtract that number from 255

128   192  224  240  248  252  254  255

/25   /26  /27  /28  /29  /30  /31  /32

###### Problem 1

10.1.1.55 /28

Step 1. 
a) Use given CIDR mask to find column on cheat sheet. In this case /28, which gives a subnet mask of 255.255.255.240 


b) find the group size (in this case 16)

c) Start at 0 in relevant Octet

d) Increase by the Group Size until passed the target IP (.55 in this example)
0 - 16 - 32 - 48 - 64

Step 2.
.55 lies between 48 and 64 so the .48 (which is before the .55) is the Network ID 

Step 3. 
The number after .55 is 64 which is the Next Network 

Step 4.
The number Before the next network is the Broadcast ID 

Step 5.
IP address AFTER the Network ID is First Host IP

Step 6.
IP address BEFORE Broadcast IP is the Last Host IP

Step 7.
Group size is total number - 2 = 14 usable addresses


###### Problem 2 -  10.1.1.37 /29

1. /29 = 255.255.255.248
2. Group size of 8 = 0 - 8 - 16 - 24 - 32 - 40 Network ID = .32
3. Next Network = .40
4. Broadcast IP = .39
5. First Host = .33
6. Last Host = .38
7. 8 - 2 = 6 Usable IPs

###### Problem 3 - 10.2.2.88 /27
1 /27 = 255.255.255.224
2. Group size = 32 = 0 - 32 - 64 - 96 Network ID = .64
3. Next Network = .96
4. Broadcast = .95
5. Fist Host = .65
6. Last Host .94
7. 32 - 2 = 30 Usable

###### Problem 4 - 10..2.2.111 /25
1. /25 = 255.255.255.128 
2. Group Size = 128 = 0 - 128 Network ID = .0
3. Next Network = .128
4. Broadcast = .127
5. First Host = ..1
6. Last Host = .126
7. 128 - 2 = 126 usable hosts
