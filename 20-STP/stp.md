#### Network Redundancy

- Redundancy is an essential part of network design
- Modern networks are expected to run 24/7/365
- If one network component fails, you must ensure that other components will take over with little or no downtime
- As much as possible, redundancy must be implemented at every possible point in the network

STP helps to stop broadcast storms caused by switches flooding broadcast frames in a loop.
