## Security Fundamentals

1. Which term describes the outside of the corporate firewall? 
- A. DMZ
- B. Perimeter 
- C. Internal
- D. Trusted

A. B, outside of the corporate firewall, generally holds equipment necessary for routing to the ISP.

2. Which term describes the area accessible to the Internet yet protected by the corporate firewall?
- A. DMZ
- B. Perimeter 
- C. Internal 
- D. Trusted

A. A - The DMZ is an area protected by the corporate firewall. The DMZ area is in between the perimeter network and the internal network.

- A. Honey pots
- B. IDS 
- C. IPS 
- D. HIDS

A. C

4. When dealing with firewalls, the term trusted network is used to describe what?
- A. Internal network
- B. The Internet
- C. The DMZ
- D. A network with SSL

A. A.

5. Which is a common attack method used to overwhelm services with traffic from multiple Internet sources?
- A. Denial of service
- B. Distributed denial of service 
- C. IP address spoofing
- D. Session hijacking

A. B.

6. Which type of device can detect an intrusion on your network? 
- A. Honey pots
- B. IDS
- C. IPS
- D. HIDS

A. B.

7. Which method can be used to stop ping sweep scans?
- A. Deploying host intrusion detection systems
- B. Deploying network intrusion detection systems
- C. Blocking RFC 1918 addresses at the perimeter
- D. Blocking ICMP echo requests and echo replies at the perimeter

A. D

8. Which appliance can be used to mitigate denial of service attacks? 
- A. Honey pots
- B. IDS 
- C. IPS 
- D. HIDS

A. C, an IPS will help mitigate denial of service attacks. 

9. Which is a common attack method used to attempt to gain access to a system using a false identity?
- A. Denial of service
- B. Distributed denial of service 
- C. IP address spoofing
- D. Session hijacking

A. C.

10. Which method would prevent tampering of data in transit? 
- A. Access control lists (ACLs)
- B. Spoofing mitigation
- C. SSL
- D. Encryption of the data

A. C. SSL offers both Encryption and authentication of the data via certificate signing. This would prevent tampering end to end. 

11. A rouge wireless access point (WAP) is created with the same SSID as the corporate SSID. The attacker has employees connect to the SSID and watches the information as itâ€™s relayed to the original SSID. What type of attack is described here?
- A. Smurf attack
- B. Compromised key attack 
- C. Sniffer attack
- D. Man in the middle attack

A. 

12. What can you use to protect against spoofing of internal IP addresses on the perimeter of your network?
- A. ACLs
- B. Intrusion detection systems
- C. SSL
- D. Host intrusion detection systems

A.

13. Which is a requirement for the use of DHCP snooping to protect a device?
- A. The device is on a layer 2 switched port on the same VLAN.
- B. The DHCP server is running on the layer 2 switch.
- C. The device is on a layer 3 routed port on the same VLAN.
- D. Configuration of a dedicated IP address for monitoring DHCP transactions.

A. 

14. What attack vector can be used for a man in the middle attack? 
- A. DHCP
- B. DNS
- C. Wireless
- D. All of the above
