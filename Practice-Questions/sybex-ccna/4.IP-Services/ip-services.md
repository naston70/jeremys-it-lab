## IP Services

1. Which method will allow you to use RFC 1918 addresses for Internet requests?
- A. CIDR
- B. Classful addressing 
- C. NAT
- D. VPN

A. C, Network Address Translation (NAT) was created to slow the depletion of Internet addresses. It does this by translating RFC 1918 privatized addresses to one or many public IP addresses. 

2. A, the inside local address is the address local to the enterprise (private) and the address is inside the enterprise.

3. C, the inside global address is the address public to the enterprise. The address is inside of or controlled by the enterprise. 

4. D. The outside global address is the address public to the enterprise. The address is outside of the enterprise or outside of its control.

5. Which command will allow you to view the NAT translations active on the router?
```
A. Router#show ip nat translations 
B. Router#show nat translations
C. Router#debug ip nat translations 
D. Router#show translations nat
