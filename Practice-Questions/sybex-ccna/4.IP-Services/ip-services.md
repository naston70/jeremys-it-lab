- D. When the queue depth is above the minimum threshold, a percentage of TCP packets are dropped 

A. D, when the queue depth is above the minimum threshold, a percentage of TCP packets are dropped. This allows the TCP window to shrink and allows a normal slowdown of TCP transmissions. This is done in the hopes that the queue will fall under the minimum threshold and return to normal.
