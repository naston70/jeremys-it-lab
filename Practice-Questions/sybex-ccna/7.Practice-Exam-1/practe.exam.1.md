- C. Router 
- D. Switch

A. B. 

2. Which benefit does a switch provide to a LAN? 
- A. Breaks up broadcast domains
- B. Breaks up collision domains
- C. Forces full-duplex on all ports
- D. Allows for a fast uplink port

A. B, switches break up collision domains by allowing micro-segmentation.  

3. When a firewall matches a URI, it is operating at which layer?
- A. Layer 7 
- B. Layer 5 
- C. Layer 4
- D. Layer 3

A. A.

- A. HDLC 
- B. PPP
- C. PPPoE 
- D. X.25

A. B, PPP is an open standard. Cisco routers default to HDLC however it is proprietary so PPP should be used for compatibility.  

7. What is the term used to describe the telephone company’s switching office?
- A. Demarcation point 
- B. Network edge
- C. Central office
- D. Main data frame

- A. Demarcation point
- B. Point of presence 
- C. Customer edge 
- D. Network edge

A. B.

9. You have several VMs in a public cloud. What is a benefit of creating NTP VNF in the public cloud for the VMs?
- A. Better time synchronization
- B. Better response time from the VMs
- C. Lower bandwidth utilization from your premises 
- D. Overcoming different time zones

A. C, lowering bandwidth between the premises and your virtual machines on the public cloud is a direct benefit of locating a NTP virtual network function on the public cloud for VM time synchronization. 

10. When deciding to move DNS into the cloud for an application on the public cloud, what is the primary decision factor?
- A. Bandwidth
- B. Response time
- C. Proper DNS resolution
- D. The cloud provider’s requirements

A. A.

11. Which protocol is connectionless and contains no flow control? 
- A. IP
- B. TCP 
- C. UDP 
- D. ICMP

A. C.

12. You plug a laptop into a network jack. When you examine the IP address, you see 10.23.2.3, which was not originally configured when you checked prior to plugging it in. What can you conclude?
- A. The network jack is not working.
- B. Your laptop has a static IP address configured. 
- C. The network is configured properly.
- D. The DHCP server is down.

A. C. 

13. Which network does the IP address 192.168.4.38/27 belong to? 
- A. 192.168.4.8/27 network
- B. 192.168.4.16/27 network
- C. 192.168.4.32/27 network
- D. 192.168.4.64/27 network

A. C.

14. What are stateless DHCPv6 servers used for?
- A. Configuring the default gateway
- B. Configuring the IPv6 address
- C. Configuring the IPv6 prefix length 
- D. Configuring the DNS server address

A. D.

15. Which mechanism in IPv6 allows for SLAAC to avoid duplicating an IPv6 address?
- A. NDP (NS/NA) 
- B. DAD (NS/NA) 
- C. SLAAC (RS/RA) 
- D. ARPv6 (NS/NA)

A. B, duplicate address detection, or DAD uses NS and NA messages to avoid duplicate addresses when SLAAC is being used. 

16. Which term best describes the IPv6 address of 2202:0ff8:0002:2344:3533:8eff:fe22:ae4c?
- A. Multicast address 
- B. EUI-64 address 
- C. Anycast address 
- D. Link-local address

A. B, note the ffee in middle of address.

17. If a switch uses the store and forward method of switching and receives a frame in which its CRC is invalid, what will happen?
- A. The switch will re-create the frame with a new CRC and correct the missing information.
- B. The switch will drop the frame and wait for retransmission of a new frame.
- C. The switch will send back a frame for retransmission of the frame.
- D. The switch will store the frame until a new frame with a matching CRC is received.

A. B.
