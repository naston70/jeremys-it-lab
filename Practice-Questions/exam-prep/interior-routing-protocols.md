## Interior Routing Protocols

#### RIP

Type			 : Distance Vector
Algo			 : Bellman-Ford
AD   			 : 120
Multicast Address: 224.0.0.9

**RIP Implementations:**

RIPv1 - Original, limited to classful routing, now obsolete

RIPv2 - Introduced for classless routing, triggered updates and multicast

RIPng - Supports IPv6, functions similarly to v2 

**Terminology:**
*Split Horizon:* Mitigates routing loops by ensuring a route is never advertised back to the neighbor from which it was learned.

*Poison Reverse:* Learned routes are advertised back to their originator as explicitly invalid

**RIP CONFIG**
```
-----------------------------------------

## Enable ripv2

router rip
 version 2
-----------------------------------------

## Disable RIPv2 auto-summary

no auto-summary
-----------------------------------------

## Designate RIPv2 interfaces by network

network [ipv4-network]
-----------------------------------------

## Originate a default routes

default-information originate
-----------------------------------------

## Designate passive interfaces

passive-interface { [interface] | default }
-----------------------------------------

## Modify equal-cost load balancing

maximum-paths [1-16]
-----------------------------------------

## TROUBLESHOOTING

show ip[v6] protocols
show ip[v6] rip database
debug ip rip {database|events}
debug ipv6 rip [interface]
```

#### EIGRP

Type			 : Distance Vector
Algo			 : DUAL
AD  			 : 90
Multicast Address: 224.0.0.10

**EIGRP Implementations:**

Terminology:
*Reported Distance:* The metric for a route advertised by a neighbor

*Feasible Distance* The distance advertised by a neighbor plus the cost to get that neighbor

*Stuck in Active (SIA)* The condition when a route becomes unreachable and not all queries for it are answered; adjacencies with unresponsive neighbors are reset

*Passive Interface* An interface which does not participate in EIGRP but whose network is advertised

*Stub Router* A router which advertises only a subset of routes, and is omitted from the route query process

**Default Timers:**

LAN - hello = 5, hold = 15
WAN - hello = 60, hello = 180

**EIGRP Configuration:**
```
## Enable EIGRP for an AS 

router eigrp AS-number
-------------------------------------------------------

## Specify a router ID formatted in IPv4 dotted-decimal

router-id [router-id]
-------------------------------------------------------

## Disable automatic classful summarization 

no auto-summary
-------------------------------------------------------

## Enable EIGRP on interfaces by ipv4-network

network [ipv4-address][wildcard-mask]
-------------------------------------------------------

## Modify maximum paths for unequal-cost load balancing

maximum paths 1-16
-------------------------------------------------------

## Configure manual summarization of outbound routes

ip summary-address eigrp [AS-number][ipv4 address][subnet mask] AD
-------------------------------------------------------

## TROUBLESHOOTING

show ip eigrp { interfaces | neighbors }
show ip eigrp { eigrp topology}
clear ip eigrp [AS-number] neighbors
debug ip eigrp [neighbor] 
```


#### OSPF

Type			 : Link-State
Algo			 : Dijkstra
AD      		 : 110
Multicast Address: 224.0.0.5-6

**OSPFv2 Link State Advertisements:**
*Router Link (type 1):* Lists neighboring routers and the cost to each; flooded within an area

*Network Link (type 2):* Generated by a DR, lists all routers on an adjacent segment, flooded within an area

*Network Summary (type 3):* Generated by an ABR, advertises routes between areas

*ASBR Summary (type 4):* Injected by an ABR into the backbone to advertise the presence of an ASBR in a non-backbone areas

*External Link (type 5):* Generated by an ASBR and flooded throughout the AS to advertise a route external to OSPF 

*Group Membership (type 6):* Used by Multicast OSPF

*NSSA External Link (type 7):* Generated by an ASBR in a not-so-stubby area; converted into a type 5 LSA by the ABR when leaving the area 

**Router Roles:**

*Internal Router:* All interfaces reside within the same area 
*Backbone Router:* A router with at least one interface in area 0
*Area Border Router:* Connects two or more areas 
*AS Boundary Router (ASBR):* Connects to additional routing domains (redistribution to or from other protocols)

**Adjacency States:**
1. Down
2. Init 
3. 2-Way
4. ExStart
5. Exchange
6. Loading
7. Full

**Message Types:**
1. Hello
2. Database Description 
3. Link State Request
4. Link State Acknowledgement 
5. Link State Update
