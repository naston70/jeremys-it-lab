## Subnetting

192.168.1.64 /26

requires as many subnets as possible with 8 hosts

2 ** N - 2 = Hosts. 

2 ** 4 - 2 = 14 hosts 

Original Subnet looks like: 192.168.1. 01 000000 = 192.168.1.64 
This becomes 192.168.1.0100 0000 = 192.168.1.64
			 192.168.1.0101 0000 = 192.168.1.80
			 192.168.1.0110 0000 = 192.168.1.96
			 192.168.1.0111 0000 = 192.168.1.112
There is now also 28 bits in there so becomes a /28 

To subnet for serial links using 192.168.1.112/28 to /30
So 2 hosts are required, 2 ** 2 - 2 = 2 Hosts
192.168.1. 011100 00  192.168.1.112 /30
192.168.1. 011101 00  192.168.1.116 /30
192.168.1. 011110 00  192.168.1.120 /30
192.168.1. 011111 00  192.168.1.124 /30
