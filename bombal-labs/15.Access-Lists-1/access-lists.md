## Access Lists (Source: David Bombal)

- Used for creating a standard or extended list to filter packets based on defined rules for source and destination host IP addresses
- These are bound to interfaces facing in or out
- ACL's help router to discard traffic before it is sent all over the network being processed by multiple devices
- ACLs are primarily configured on firewalls but can be configured on routers as well 
- The process of checking an ACL is it checks the first rules for matching statements either permit or deny
