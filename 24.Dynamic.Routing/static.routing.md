# Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routes are routes learned by using dynamic routing protocols. 
Routing protocols are configured on routers for the purpose of exchanging router information.

* A network gains from the fact you do not need to manually configure every route on every router in a network and if links fail, routers can advertise some routes have failed and select a new path to that network. 

* Costs more in CPU and bandwidth plus adds complexity to the network
