# Notes from Jeremy's IT Lab Anki flashcards and Wendell Odom CCNA 201-300

* Ethernet header 'Type/Length' 		= 2 bytes
* Ethernet header 'Preamble'    		= 7 bytes
* Ethernet header 'SFD'					= 1 byte
* Ethernet trailer 'FCS'				= 4 bytes
* Size of the Ethernet header + trailer = 18 bytes

What is the minimum size of an Ethernet frame? (Header + Payload + Trailer) = **64 bytes**
What is the minimum size of an Ethernet Payload? = 46 bytes
