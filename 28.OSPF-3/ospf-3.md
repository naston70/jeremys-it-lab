# OSPF NETWORK TYPES

* The OSPF 'network type' refers to the type of connection between OSPF neighbors (Ethernet, etc)
* There are 3 main OSPF network types:
	- **Broadcast:** enabled by default on Ethernet and FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interfaces) interfaces
	- **Point-to-Point:** enabled by default on PPP and HDLC interfaces
	- **Non-broadcast:** enabled by default on Frame Relays and X.25 interfaces

#### Broadcast Network Type

* Enabled on Ethernet and FDDI by default
* Routers dynamically discover neighbors by sending/listening for OSPF hello messages using multicast address 224.0.0.5
* A DR (designated router) and BDR (backup designated router) must be elected on each subnet (only DR if there are no OSPF neighbors)
* Routers which aren't the DR or BDR become a DROther
* The DR/BDR election order of priority is:
	1. The highest OSPF interface priority
	2. The highest OSPF Router ID

* First place becomes the DR for the subnet, second place becomes the BDR
* The default OSPF interface priority is 1 on all interfaces
* In the broadcast network type, routers will only form a full OSPF adjacency with the DR and BDR of the segment
* Therefore routers only exchange LSAs with the DR and BDR. DROthers will not exchanges LSAs with each other
* All routers will have the same LSDB, but this reduces the amount of LSAs flooding the network
* The DR and BDR will form a FULL adjacency with all routers in the subnet
* DROthers will only form a full adjacency with BR/BDR
```
#show ip ospf interface interface
```
This command provides more details of Neighbors and Adjacency counts

#### Point-to-Point Network Type

- Enables on serial interfaces using the PPP or HDLC encapsulations by default
- Routers dynamically discover neighbors by sending/listening for OSPF Hello messages using multicast address 224.0.0.5
- A BR and BDR are not elected
- The encapsulations are used for point-to-point connections
- No need for a BR and BDR in a ptp connection
- The two routers will form a Full adjacency with each other


#### OSPF Neighbor Requirements

* Must be in same OSPF area
* Interfaces must be in the same subnet
* OSPF process must not be shutdown
* OSPF router IDs must be unique
* Hello and Dead Timers must match
* Authentication settings must match
* IP MTU settings must match
* OSPF network type must match

#### OSPF LSA Types

- The OSPF LSDB is made up of LSAs
- There are 11 types of LSAs but only 3 needed for CCNA
- They are:
	1. Type 1 (Router LSA)
	2. Type 2 (Network LSA)
	3. Type 5 (AS External LSA)

- TYPE 1 (Router LSA):
	* Every OSPF router generates this type of LSA
	* It identifies the router using the router ID
	* It also lists networks attached to the routers OSPF enabled interfaces

- TYPE 2 (Network LSA):
	* Generated by the DR of each 'multi-access' network (ie the broadcast network type)
	* Lists the routers which are attached to the multi-access network

- TYPE 3 (AS-External LSA):
	* Generated by ASBRs to describe routes to destination outside of the AS
