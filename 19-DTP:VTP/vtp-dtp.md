# DTP and VTP

DTP - Dynamic Trunking Protocol

- DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows Cisco switches to dynamically determine their interface stattus (access or trunk) without manual configuration
- DTP is enabled by default on all Cisco switch interfaces
- So far, in this course, switchports have been configured using:
	- switchport mode access OR
	- switchport mode trunk
- For security purposes, manual configuration is recommended. DTP should be disabled on all ports
